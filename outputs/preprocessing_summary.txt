Processing Steps:
-----------------
1.  Merged transaction + identity data
2.  Created 8 engineered features
3.  Removed 74 high-missing columns (>80%)
4.  Imputed numeric (median) and categorical (Unknown)
5.  Label encoded high-cardinality categoricals
6.  One-hot encoded low-cardinality categoricals
7.  Train/test split (80/20, stratified)
8.  Applied SMOTE for class balancing
9.  Scaled features with StandardScaler
